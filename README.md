# Balloon Game Prototype

## 🎮 Overview
This is a balloon-bursting game prototype created as part of the internship assignment for IDZ Digital. The game simulates inflating a balloon using a pump, floating it with a random letter, and then bursting it on tap/click. A new balloon and letter appear after each burst, creating an endless loop.

## ✨ Features
- Click the pump to inflate the balloon.
- A random letter (A–Z) appears on the balloon.
- When fully inflated, the balloon floats randomly on the screen.
- Tap/click the balloon to burst it.
- A new balloon and letter appear automatically.
